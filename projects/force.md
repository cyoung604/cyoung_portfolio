Force sensor 

## Experimental Setup & Methods
- **Model:** 1:4 scale rowing paddle tested in a 24" × 24" × 24" quiescent water tank  
- **Flow similarity:** Reynolds number Re ≈ 2.2 × 10⁴  
- **Velocity scaling:** κ = u₍experiment₎ / u₍scaled₎ = 0.5 (selected due to facility constraints)  
- **Force/torque sensing:** ATI Mini40 6-axis force/torque sensor  
- **Post-processing:** V
