# Experimental Fluids Research: PIV Analysis of Rowing Blades

## Objective
(1–2 sentences: what question are you answering?)

## My Role
- Experimental fixture design and fabrication
- PIV data collection and flow visualization
- MATLAB post-processing (velocity, vorticity, circulation)

## Setup & Methods
- Hardware: (laser, camera, blade mount, force sensor if used)
- Workflow: acquisition → processing → plotting → circulation calculation

## Results
