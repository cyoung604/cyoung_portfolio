Mechanical Engineering Student | Experimental Fluids (PIV) | Mechanical Design

I build and test hardware, then turn experimental data into clear plots and design decisions (PIV, Flow Visualization, instrumentation, CAD, prototyping).

**Core strengths:** PIV & flow visualization • MATLAB/Python analysis • CAD + 3D printing • Experimental fixtures & calibration

## Projects
### Experimental Fluids Research: PIV Analysis of Rowing Blades
Designed fixtures, ran PIV experiments, and processed velocity/vorticity fields in MATLAB to compute circulation and compare configurations.

- Methods: PIV acquisition, calibration, vorticity + circulation post-processing
- Outputs: vorticity fields, circulation vs time, documented research summary

### Experimental Fluids Research: Force Analysis of Rowing Blades (Ongoing)
Designed and validated force-measurement experiments to quantify hydrodynamic loads on rowing blades and blade attachments using a 6-axis force/torque sensor.

- Developed and 3D-printed fixtures to integrate an ATI Mini40 force sensor with submerged test bodies and rowing blade assemblies
- Performed calibration and validation experiments using a cylindrical rod dragged through water at 0–3 m/s
- Compared measured drag forces against analytical predictions using drag coefficients from Munson et al. to verify sensor accuracy
- Applied validated force-measurement methods to compare RANDALLfoil blade attachments against standard blades

- **Methods:** force/torque sensing (ATI Mini40), analytical drag modeling, experimental calibration, MATLAB data analysis  
- **Outputs:** force vs velocity plots, calibration validation results, blade force comparisons
