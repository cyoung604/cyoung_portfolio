## About Me
I am a mechanical engineering student with hands-on experience in experimental fluid dynamics, mechanical design, and system/data analysis. I love working on projects that involve design and iteration.

# Projects
# Experimental Fluids Research – PIV Analysis
**Role:** Experimental design, data processing, analysis  
- Designed and fabricated experimental fixtures  
- Conducted PIV measurements and flow visualization  
- Processed velocity and vorticity fields in MATLAB
