# Caleb Young
Mechanical Engineering Student | Experimental Fluids (PIV) | Mechanical Design

I build and test hardware, then turn experimental data into clear plots and design decisions (PIV, Flow Visualization, instrumentation, CAD, prototyping).

**Core strengths:** PIV & flow visualization • MATLAB/Python analysis • CAD + 3D printing • Experimental fixtures & calibration

## Projects
### Experimental Fluids Research: PIV Analysis of Rowing Blades
Designed fixtures, ran PIV experiments, and processed velocity/vorticity fields in MATLAB to compute circulation and compare configurations.

- Methods: PIV acquisition, calibration, vorticity + circulation post-processing
- Outputs: vorticity fields, circulation vs time, documented research summary

### Experimental Fluids Research: Force analysis of Rowing Blades(ongoing)
Designed fixtures, talk about using mini40 force sensor to get force data, randallfoil blade vs normal rowing blade
calcualted force sensor on a cylinder rod in water first with graphs shown in projects,

need to update methods below
- Methods: PIV acquisition, calibration, vorticity + circulation post-processing
- Outputs: vorticity fields, circulation vs time, documented research summary
