# Caleb Young
Mechanical Engineering Student | Experimental Fluids (PIV & Force Measurement) | Mechanical Design

I build and test experimental hardware, then turn fluid and force measurements into clear plots and design decisions using PIV, instrumentation, and data analysis.

**Strengths:** PIV & flow visualization • MATLAB/Python analysis • Force/torque sensing • CAD & 3D printing • Experimental fixtures & calibration

## Projects

### Experimental Fluids Research: PIV Analysis of Rowing Blades
Designed experimental fixtures, conducted PIV measurements, and processed velocity and vorticity fields in MATLAB to compute circulation and compare blade configurations.

- **Methods:** PIV acquisition, calibration, velocity and vorticity post-processing, circulation computation  
- **Outputs:** instantaneous and time-averaged vorticity fields, circulation vs. time, documented research summaries

### Experimental Fluids Research: Force Analysis of Rowing Blades (Ongoing)
Designed and validated force-measurement experiments to quantify hydrodynamic loads on rowing blades and blade attachments using a 6-axis force/torque sensor.

- Designed and 3D-printed fixtures to integrate an ATI Mini40 force sensor with submerged test bodies and rowing blade assemblies  
- Performed calibration and validation experiments using a cylindrical rod dragged through water at 0–3 m/s  
- Compared measured drag forces to analytical predictions using literature drag coefficients (Munson et al.) to verify sensor accuracy  
- Applied validated force-measurement methods to compare RANDALLfoil blade attachments against standard rowing blades  

- **Methods:** force/torque sensing (ATI Mini40), analytical drag modeling, experimental calibration, MATLAB data analysis  
- **Outputs:** force-vs-velocity plots, calibration validation results, blade force comparisons
